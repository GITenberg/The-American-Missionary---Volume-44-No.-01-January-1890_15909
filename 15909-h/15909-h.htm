    <h3>NEW YEAR'S GREETINGS.</h3>
    <p>The New Year opens upon this Association auspiciously. The setting
    sun of our old year went down in a bright sky. Revivals of religion and an
    increased membership was the joyful record of our churches; by the generous
    aid of the Daniel Hand Fund, our schools showed a greatly enlarged
    attendance, and the faithful work of the teachers brought forth most satisfactory
    results; the threatened debt that darkened several months of the
    year was happily averted by good showing on the right side of the ledger.</p>
    <p>It is from this bright setting sun of the last year that we turn with faith
    and hope to the opening of the new year. We believe, the work is the
    Lord's and that he will provide. But our faith alone will not save us. It
    is our duty to inform and arouse our constituents as to the needs and urgency
    of our work. We will specify in a few particulars:</p>
    <p>1. As to funds. Our last year's favorable showing was due in large
    part to legacies. These are variable, and we must rely on the gifts of <i>living
    donors</i>. Unless, therefore, the churches and individuals make larger
    contributions than last year, we have no assurance of an escape from debt,
    even if the work be maintained merely as at present. We wish most earnestly
    to press this fact upon the friends of the Association.</p>
    <p>2. But this is not all. Growth is imperative. The people at the North
    are alarmed by the disturbed condition of the South, and are awakening
    afresh, as they were at the close of the war, to a sense of responsibility to
    the colored people. The aroused feeling at that time took a practical turn,
    and money, men and women were sent without stint to enlighten and elevate.
    Shall it be so now, or will mere sympathy or useless regret suffice?
    No! Something, the <i>right thing</i>, can be done. Fair-minded men, both
    North and South, realize that all schemes involving fraud, violence, disfranchisement
    or deportation, are impracticable, but all are agreed as to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg 2]</span>
    the value of Christian enlightenment, enabling the Negro to earn property
    and to become an intelligent and virtuous citizen. This is the line on
    which the Association has perseveringly toiled since it opened its first
    school at Fortress Monroe in 1861, and it is not too much to say that nothing
    more effective has been done in all these years. Can anything of a
    better sort be done in the future? Amid all the jarring discords at the
    South, the people there, both white and black, welcome the efforts of the
    Association. They feel that we are not disturbers, that we have a single
    honest aim, and are working at the only true solution of the great problem.
    We ask the people of the North, therefore, to come to the rescue once
    more by practical, self-denying liberality.</p>
    <p>3. but this is not all. a work so vital to the interests of the nation and
    of the cause of christ needs to be uplifted by the prayers of god's people.
    deliverance cannot come from political parties, governmental authority or
    theories of industrial reform. the power of god must be in it. we
    therefore respectfully but earnestly ask our brethren in the ministry to remember
    this work in their prayers in the great congregation, and we ask
    our fellow christians to remember it in the prayer-meeting, at the family
    altar and in the closet.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial2" id="editorial2"></a>
    <p>&quot;Now, concerning the collection.&quot; These are not the words of a begging
    agent, but of Paul the Apostle, and they come from his pen just after
    he had closed that wonderful fifteenth chapter of First Corinthians on the
    glorious resurrection and the victory over death and the grave. These
    words are fit, therefore, in any assembly and at the close of any discourse
    however exalted. Brethren remember the &quot;collection.&quot;</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The Corinthian church seems, like some churches in recent times, to have
    been remiss in sending on the &quot;collections,&quot; and hence we find Paul, a
    year later, to be &quot;After Money Again.&quot; He writes so nobly, so kindly, that
    we are tempted to quote a few sentences:</p>
    <p>&quot;For ye know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was
    rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might
    be rich. And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you who
    have begun before not only to do but also to be forward a year ago. Now
    therefore perform the doing of it. As it is written, He that had gathered
    much had nothing over; and he that gathered little had no lack.&quot;</p>
    <hr />
    <p>The National Council has appointed Committees to take into consideration
    the consolidation of the missionary magazines and the re-adjustment of
    the work of the several Congregational missionary societies. We are happy
    to furnish these committees with all the facts in our possession on these
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg 3]</span>
    subjects, and this Association will, in accordance with its fundamental theory,
    cheerfully acquiesce in what shall be found to be the deliberate and ultimate
    decision of the churches. In the meantime, it may not be out of place for
    us to say that missionary periodicals and missionary societies are growths
    and not manufactured articles, and that plans for modification should be
    very carefully considered. We venture, therefore, to suggest that counsel
    be taken of the Town Clerk of Ephesus, &quot;to do nothing rashly.&quot;</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial3" id="editorial3"></a>
    <h4>AFRICA.&mdash;ITS SHADOW AND SUNSHINE.</h4>
    <p>The shadow is still broad and dense, well nigh covering the continent.
    The heroic Stanley has found that shadow as dark as when he first traveled
    beneath it. The malarial climate and the bitter hostility of the
    natives are there yet. The accursed slave trade is as extensive as ever,
    embittering the lives of its victims, instigating wars among the tribes
    and obstructing agriculture, commerce and civilization. The failures
    to suppress it are discouraging. Sir Samuel Baker's well-equipped military
    force, Col. Gordon's intrepid courage, and Emin Pacha's brave
    endurance have all succumbed before it. Its flow, pushed back for a
    time, now returns with its old-time flood. Then, too, the Mahdi uprising,
    seemingly suppressed, still lives and is likely to hold the Soudan if
    not to harass Egypt. When Emin Pacha, under the protection of the
    heroic Stanley, abandoned his little sovereignty, it was a farewell, humanly
    speaking, to a speedy establishment of missions in that territory.</p>
    <p>But there is a bright lining around all this darkness. For one thing
    the eyes of the civilized world are turned toward Africa with increasing
    intensity. The rainbow fringe of missions around the coasts is still sustained
    by the gifts and prayers of Christians, and by the blessing of God.
    The multiplied efforts of the European States to colonize the dark continent
    are facts full of encouragement. The motive may be selfish; the
    method sometimes unwise and cruel, and the conflict of contending interests
    may be hindrances, but the results will be good. All these movements
    aim at commerce, and commerce can only flourish on the ruins of the
    slave-trade, and among peaceful tribes with growing industries, intelligence
    and civilization. The Congo Free State, with its railroad in construction,
    its steamboats on the rivers and its civilized settlements, is a bright omen
    of the future.</p>
    <p>Surely God's people should pray for Africa, moved by pity and by
    hope. Christians in America can do more than pray&mdash;they can help to
    answer their own prayers. They can raise up the sons and daughters of
    Africa, trained in our schools, to go forth as missionaries and colonists to
    the land of their fathers. The experiment has been tried with success.
    Missionaries of African descent can endure the climate better, and can
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page4" id="page4"></a>[pg 4]</span>
    more readily reach the people than those of the white race. There
    is a call in these facts for the means to give special instruction in Biblical
    truth to those who can thus be prepared for this great mission work.</p>
    <hr />
    <a name="editorial4" id="editorial4"></a>
    <h4>CONVENTIONS OF COLORED PEOPLE.</h4>
    <p>The proposed National Conventions of colored people to be held in
    Chicago and Washington are significant facts. They indicate that the
    colored people are suffering wrongs, and that they feel a call to seek redress.
    Their right to hold such conventions is unquestioned; the wisdom
    of holding them will be vindicated, we hope, by their just and reasonable
    utterances and plans. Intemperate language and rash and impracticable
    measures will not help, and we have so much confidence in the discretion
    of our colored friends that we believe none such will be said or proposed.</p>
    <p>Our colored brethren must not forget that much is being done for them
    and that they are doing much for themselves. It would be unwise to overlook
    this in any attempt to reach something less tangible.</p>
    <p>Their appeal to the justice of the Nation, to the Constitution and the
    laws can be made invincible, but it will be well to keep in touch with the
    sympathy of the North and with the conscience of the South, for in spite
    of all the wrongs inflicted on the colored people in the South, we believe
    there is a large and growing number of Southern people who look upon
    this whole question conscientiously, and although perplexed desire that
    the right shall be done.</p>
    <p>For the colored people themselves, while conventions are good, yet the
    accumulation of property, growth in intelligence, and character are better.</p>
    <hr />
    <h4>SCHOOL ECHOES.</h4>
    <p>A boy in one of the arithmetic classes was given an example which began
    with the statement, that a man deposited a certain sum of money in a
    bank. He was asked if he knew what a bank was. He replied; &quot;Yes, it
    is a place where you dig coal.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;What is the shape of the earth?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;The earth is square. Pap says so, and he says the Book says so too.
    He says if there warn't four corners, how could the four angels stand
    on 'em.&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I hear you'uns have taken your children out of school. What did you
    do that for?&quot;</p>
    <p>&quot;I'll tell ye. I yaint goin' to send my child to any such fool-teacher as
    that ar. Why, he tole 'em that the world was roun', an' any fool knows
    better.&quot;</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page5" id="page5"></a>[pg 5]</span></p>
    <p>A Methodist minister in North Carolina, preaching from the passage
    about standing at the corners of the streets to pray, told his people that if
    they wanted to see a &quot;first class hypocrite,&quot; see anybody who would stand
    up to pray. The <i>standing up</i> was what he thought Jesus reproved.</p>
    <p>A man in the South writes to us as follows, making an unusual inquiry:</p>
    <p>&quot;I write you this to ask you do you take married ladies in your school,
    and if so I want to send my wife at once. Please send me the terms of the
    school and what she will need. My wife wants an education and my desire
    is to give it to her. You will greatly oblige me to answer this on return
    mail.&quot;</p>

    <h4>ADDRESS OF PRESIDENT EATON,</h4>
    <h5>AT THE ANNUAL MEETING IN CHICAGO.</h5>
    <p>God, who writes his thoughts in the development of a nation, not less
    than in the grouping of constellations or in the drama of the physical world,
    has spoken in the birth and history of our land with startling distinctness.
    In every people we may see an ideal of God embodied, however imperfectly
    realized by human achievement. Happy is that people who can see God's
    ideal for them, and those statesmen who have it in their hearts to lead the
    people along the line of God's thought. To get at something of God's
    thought for us, we must go back even into those dark Teutonic forests into
    which the Roman world peered with so much fear and awe, and out of
    which came those freemen who knew how to leap upon that Roman world
    in its pride and its weakness and re-assert human liberty.</p>
    <p>Those old ancestors of ours knew what freedom was; but as they came
    against that Roman world, they themselves were in part conquered by it,
    and they lost something of that freedom. But God set apart one corner of
    the European world for them, and called over the English Channel in the
    fifth century those forefathers of ours, there to watch for a century and a
    half that tremendous conflict in which the very plow-share of the Teutons
    went through the roots of the Roman life in Britain and left nothing but
    Teutonic fields remaining. And then God brought into this Britain, thus
    set apart, the gospel of Christ, and our forefathers became Christians&mdash;not
    Christians such as there were in other parts of Europe, but having that free
    and independent Christian life that shone forth in men like Wyckliffe,
    denying the power of the keys to Rome except where Rome spoke with
    Christ's voice, and in men like Latimer, before whom the proud Henry
    trembled.</p>
    <p>All over England were sown these seeds of a free Christian
    faith; so that when Luther came, it was in England as in our country when
    the forest fires have ceased, and suddenly there spring up from the sod a
    new forest because the seeds lie in the prairie from age to age. So in our
    English soil there were those seeds of Christian freedom that sprung forth
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg 6]</span>
    and gave us a free and Protestant England. And then, in the reaction,
    when Mary was on the throne, and the fire at Smithfield was kindled, the
    Christian men of England went to Geneva and there met John Calvin, whose
    system of Christian thought set the soul of man forth, in his awful agony of
    sin, and in God's redemption for him&mdash;set him forth independent of kings
    and rulers, and in whose sight a king was but God's vassal. When Englishmen
    had to come in contact with John Calvin, the iron of his free spirit
    became steel, and then Puritanism was born, and at that time God raised
    the curtain that hung over a whole hemisphere, and gave that hemisphere
    to these free Teutonic English people. We know how they conquered the
    country for this free spirit, and how the Revolutionary War came on, and
    Samuel Adams, awakening to the sound of those cannon at Concord on
    that spring morning, said, in spite of all the forebodings of a long and deadly
    struggle, &quot;How glorious is this morning,&quot; because he foresaw what
    God could work here in a free Christian land. And so on that following
    Fourth of July those men assembled in Philadelphia and put forth the
    Declaration of Independence. There is no better commentary on it than
    Lincoln's words when he said, in those dark days just before the war: &quot;In
    their enlightened view nothing stamped with the divine image and likeness
    was sent into the world to be trodden on or degraded or imbruted by its
    fellows.&quot;</p>
    <p>They set up a beacon for their children and their children's children.
    Wise statesmen as they were, they knew the tendency of prosperity
    to breed tyrants, and so they established these great self-evident
    truths, that when at some remote time some man, or faction, or interest
    should arise, and say that none but rich men, or none but white men, or
    none but Anglo-Saxon white men were entitled to life, liberty, and the pursuit
    of happiness, their children's children should look back to the Declaration
    of Independence, and should take heart to begin again the battles
    their forefathers fought, that thus truth and liberty and righteousness and
    justice and all the Christian virtues might not be lost in the land; and none
    might dare limit and circumscribe the principles on which the temple of
    liberty was being built. Thus, by these centuries of growth and life God
    said to our people, &quot;I have given you this key to your history, the union of
    liberty and an enlightened faith&mdash;faith and freedom. Be true to these.
    This do and thou shalt live.&quot; It seems plain enough. And yet, in this
    garden of liberty there were sown tares. In the bosom of this free land the
    deadly foe of freedom, slavery, was here. In slavery was the evident and
    necessary foe of all that God had foreplanned for our Nation, because slavery
    denies the rights of men. Men tried to deal with this problem; they
    tried to circumscribe it; they said it was a local question, and Webster
    stood in the Senate and boasted that he had never spoken of slavery on that
    floor. How the way of liberty was choked, how the tree of liberty withered!
    And then God spoke in the earthquake, and the fire, the war came on, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg 7]</span>
    the slave was set free; and it seemed as if again we had come into sight of
    God's plan for the race, that liberty and Christian faith should be the
    watchword of our national life.</p>
    <p>Now again, at last, it seems as if that which we are accomplishing and
    that which God has spoken in all these ages is again jeopardized, and as if
    this human right shall be denied in the South. Men doubt whether there
    is in the Negro more than the capacity of a subordinate race, and say that
    to educate him is to lift him out of his sphere. Brethren and friends, there
    is manhood in the Negro race. There was humanity in those slaves who
    toiled their way over mountains and through swamps before the war, with
    their eyes focussed upon the North star of freedom. And there was
    humanity in those mothers who clasped their babes to their breast and fled
    before the bloodhounds that they might escape the enslavers of men.
    There was manhood in those one hundred and seventy-eight thousand
    Negro soldiers who seized their muskets and went to the front and fought
    for us, and with us, in those dark days of 1864, when the draft was failing
    and when volunteering had failed, that there might be soldiers to stand in
    the front and to dig in the trenches, and of whom eighty thousand gave
    their lives for us. There was manhood in those cabins in which all over
    the South, our fleeing soldiers, escaping from prison, never failed to find
    support, help, and guidance. Oh! how disastrous a business it is that
    that manhood, which all those years of slavery could not extinguish, should
    now be extinguished by the priests of a proud, arrogant, and selfish aristocracy.</p>
    <p>But, my friends, as we felt in those days, and feel to-night, there is still
    no help for us but in the Christian solution of this problem and in the
    Christian destiny God has given to us. Liberty and faith, the two elements,
    must be conjoined. For us to deny the rights of the Negro now is
    to say that God did not make man in his image. It is to say that liberty
    is not a sacred right, but a selfish acquisition; that government does not
    exist to establish rights, but to protect privileges, and that mankind are not
    brothers, but foes. It is to turn the shadow upon the dial of human progress
    backward toward the ages of oppression and chaos.</p>
    <p>And just there is the problem that confronts us, South and North together.
    What shall be done in this dire extremity? I remember years
    ago hearing of a fire in Charleston in which that beautiful spire of St.
    Michael's took fire and some one had to be found to go up beyond the
    reach of the hose to put out the flame kindling and flickering there. No
    one was found until a Negro stepped forth and climbed that tower, taking
    his life in his hands, and put out that flame. And when he came down
    again, one man said, &quot;Name your reward,&quot; and he replied, &quot;Let me but be
    counted a man.&quot; And that we have got to do, or God will shake down
    our civilization and our Nation as he shook down that spire of St. Michael's
    in the earthquake three years ago. It is certain to come unless we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg 8]</span>
    follow the line of God's appointing that this must be a free Nation, absolutely
    free, free everywhere. As yet, emancipation is but an outward and
    formal thing. What we wait for now, is the emancipation of a true and an
    elevated will in the South, and Christian citizenship. Into that, this Association
    pours its strength, its money, and its life. It took half a
    million lives to emancipate the slaves outwardly, and it may yet take
    hundreds and thousands of lives&mdash;our lives&mdash;our children's lives&mdash;poured
    in upon this problem, that so we may lift the Negro to that point where he
    feels himself, and where we feel him to be, a man&mdash;taught to labor, protected
    in the enjoyment of the fruits of his labor, without which the
    strongest arm grows palsied, trained in a strong, self-reliant Christian manhood,
    holding the reins firmly on the neck of all passion&mdash;a man. And
    that we will do; and the very greatness of the problem, I believe, is our
    redemption. It was the greatness of the crisis that thrilled the Nation's
    heart when the war burst upon us. It is the very greatness of our present
    problem that calls in trumpet tones to men and women and children all
    over the land; &quot;Come and help solve this problem for Christ.&quot;</p>
    <p>A few weeks ago, in one of the beautiful towns of Northern Illinois, a
    young man, the only son of his father and mother, hearing at Sabbath
    evening the alarm of fire, sprung forth and took his place upon the burning
    building and there did the work of a fireman. In the attempt to put
    out the fire he was hurled headlong and in one moment his life had gone
    hence. A few weeks afterward, as a friend was talking with his mother about
    it, she said, &quot;Our son was always so swift to heed any call of need or duty, it
    seems to me as if he heard suddenly some call from God from some farther
    clime and sprung forth and was gone from our sight.&quot; Blessed, heroic
    faith! But, brethren and friends, fathers and mothers, we need that same
    faith for our living sons and living daughters, to send them forth into this
    work of God. When the Christ child was on the back of the giant Christophorus
    crossing the stream, how heavy he grew as the giant plunged his
    way through the waters. God weighs heavily upon this Nation this greatest
    of all national problems, what to do with these despised ones. But
    bear the burden we must, and bear it through we must to the farther shore
    of a Christian solution, or we and it will go down the flood together.
    There is no help for us except in this solution which makes brothers of
    these men.</p>
    <p>I see a possible issue in this large Christian faith of our land; and I
    see the time coming when the black and the white shall dwell together in a
    mutual helpfulness, with a more complete national feeling, a deeper dependence
    upon him from whom alone comes strength, less display of material resources,
    but more faith in God. That time must come. And then I see
    the army enlisting for the conquest of that dark continent of Africa,
    shrouded in gloom, so long robbed of her children, but now at last finding
    that, like Joseph, they were taken from her that they might come back to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg 9]</span>
    save life. So our Nation shall be not a mirage awakening the hopes and
    aspirations of mankind but to mock them, and leaving the sands of human
    experience still more arid and barren; but it shall be a mountain of God,
    its base resting on the eternal foundations of law and liberty; its summit
    drawing down from the willing heavens the streams of prosperity which
    shall enrich all the lands of the earth.</p>

    <h3>THE SOUTH</h3>
    <h4>FIELD NOTES.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY REV. FRANK E. JENKINS.</p>
    <p>I reached Little Rock, Arkansas, late one Saturday night and on Sunday
    morning found my way to our church service. Arriving a few minutes
    late, I found the service already begun. It was a fine looking audience and
    as quiet and orderly as any New England congregation. The service was
    well arranged and conducted in a very happy manner. The sermon was
    thoughtful, earnest and inspiring. The pastor, Rev. Yancy B. Sims, is a
    graduate of Talladega College and an honor to his Alma Mater. On Monday
    I visited, with the pastor, several of the homes of the people. What a
    contrast between these refined homes and the hut of the slave quarters of
    twenty-five years ago! The ladies of this church had just finished a silk
    block for a quilt which a home mission church in Washington Territory is
    making from blocks made in each State in the Union, with the hope of selling
    it to increase its fund for building a house of worship. It was a beautiful
    block of rich material and the most delicate workmanship. The faces
    of these ladies showed great delight in the thought that they were helping
    others who needed help.</p>
    <p>&quot;Do the colored people vote here without opposition?&quot; I asked of an
    intelligent colored man. &quot;Oh, yes!&quot; he replied. &quot;And are the votes always
    counted?&quot; &quot;Yes, <i>except in a pinch!</i>&quot; was the answer. This is much better
    than in most places which I am called upon to visit.</p>
    <p>From Little Rock I went to Paris, Texas. This growing city has a population
    of about twelve thousand, five thousand of whom are colored. Our
    pastor here is a graduate of Fisk University, as also is his wife. The need
    of our church work in this city and in the State is two-fold, direct and indirect.
    Our Congregational churches are quite as useful for toning up other
    churches and their ministry as in the direct work done by them.</p>
    <p>Dodds, Roxton and Dallas in Northern Texas were next visited, and in
    each a small church is established and doing a good work.</p>
    <p>At Austin, I found our Tillotson Institute rapidly filling with students&mdash;bright
    and earnest. A girls' hall is greatly needed here at once. This institution
    with its unlimited opportunities in the great State of Texas ought
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg 10]</span>
    not to be cramped in any way, but to be given every facility. Who will give
    it at once what it so urgently needs? I found several intelligent people
    here greatly desiring a Congregational church in the city&mdash;the school-church
    being too far away to reach the mass of the people. Said an educated
    colored man to me: &quot;Our most intelligent people cannot endure the
    ignorant worship of these old churches much longer. We want Congregationalism,
    but if we can't have that, we must look elsewhere. We must
    have something to hold our educated young people from falling into infidelity.&quot;
    And so they must, for that is a coming danger.</p>
    <p>At Helena, I found a most interesting state of things. Our church is in
    a country place called &quot;The Colony.&quot; The church and the colony began
    their existence together, and a more prosperous community of colored
    people it would be hard to find. They own several thousand acres of land,
    and are in every way ahead of their white neighbors. The school house of
    the latter was a poor tumble-down affair and the children were untidy,
    while the school house of the former was a neat, painted and well-kept
    building, crowded in school hours with bright, enthusiastic children&mdash;clean
    and polite. The teacher was from Talladega College and has taught here
    for five years. His school is pronounced the best in the region for white
    or colored. The pastor of this church has charge also of the Congregational
    Church at Goliad.</p>
    <p>Corpus Christi is a curious town on the Gulf of Mexico. It has about
    6,000 people&mdash;Americans, Mexicans, Negroes, Italians, Greeks and Chinese.
    The Negroes here hold an unusual position, being regarded as in
    every way superior to the Mexicans and Italians. Our pastor here is popular
    with all classes and has been chosen an alderman of the city, and is
    treated with as much consideration as any other of the City Council.</p>
    <p>Our church is one of the oldest Congregational churches in the South,
    and has had a very interesting history. With the exception of the Roman
    Catholic church it has the best house of worship in the city. On Sunday
    afternoon, Rev. Mr. Strong, the Congregational pastor, and myself
    attended service at the Roman Catholic church. We went into the body
    of the church and took a first class seat, and the fact that one was colored
    did not even draw attention to us. It was taken as a matter of course.
    The colored people of Texas are taxed for $20,000,000 of property. In
    the cities they make up about one-third of the population. An enlargement
    of our church work in this State is greatly needed.</p>
    <p>Straight University in New Orleans, La., is an inspiring place. I found
    the buildings packed full&mdash;seats full, chairs in the aisles, in the corners and
    on the teachers' platforms&mdash;all full. About one hundred and fifty applicants
    had already been sent away for want of room, and they were still
    coming, as many as ten often being refused in a single day. They were
    here not only from the States, but also from Mexico, the West Indies and
    Central America. I saw here some remarkable work in moulding done by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg 11]</span>
    a student in the fifth grade, who had never been trained, but who seems to
    be impelled by real genius. Straight University has a unique position and
    opportunity. Its influence is now great; it is destined to be boundless.</p>
    <p>From the Chicago meeting I made this trip. The meeting was inspiring,
    but what I saw in the field, of character-building and the uplifting and
    refining of a race, was more than inspiring&mdash;it was thrilling.</p>
    <p>At Dodds and Roxton a few hymn books are needed. A dozen or two
    Gospel Hymns or other singing books for each church would do great good.
    Papers for the children are also needed. They should be sent to Rev.
    Mark Carlisle, Dodds, Texas.</p>
    <p>Papers for the children could be well used at Paris, Texas, Rev. J.D.
    Pettigrew; Dallas, Texas, Rev. Mr. Holloway; Helena and Goliad, Texas,
    Rev. M. Thompson; Corpus Christi, Texas, Rev. J.W. Strong.</p>

    <h4>REVIVAL AT WASHINGTON, D.C.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY REV. GEO. W. MOORE.</p>
    <p>There have been over forty conversions reported and thirty have been
    added to our church on profession of faith. There is a revival now in
    progress at the Freedmen's Hospital as a direct outgrowth of our meetings.
    Several of the young people of our church, including some of the
    converts, were instrumental in leading a number to the Saviour. I am
    planning to assist them in dealing with inquirers there, to-night. There
    have been revival services in three other churches. The meetings held in
    our place were indeed a season of refreshing from the presence of the
    Lord.</p>
    <p>Our chapel was crowded on Thanksgiving morning; the sermon was
    preached by Rev. Dr. Grimke, pastor of the Fifteenth Street Presbyterian
    Church, followed by an address by myself. The pastors of the Berean
    Baptist Church, Methodist Church and the Lutheran Mission were on the
    platform, the Plymouth Church holding a service of their own. In the evening
    we held a Thanksgiving praise service, in which about one hundred
    persons, including thirty-five of the converts, gave short thanksgiving
    testimonies.</p>
    <p>Last Sabbath I baptized fourteen by immersion and received twenty-seven
    into the church on profession of faith, and three since, making
    a total of thirty. Rev. Eugene May of Osage, Iowa, one of the delegates
    I met at the World's Sunday-school Convention this summer
    in London, gave us a powerful sermon on the characters of &quot;Dives
    and Lazarus Contrasted.&quot; In the evening I preached a sermon to
    the church on &quot;The Christian Armor&quot; and we had the Lord's Supper.
    Last night, after addressing the young Christians on &quot;The Way to God,&quot;
    as illustrated by the worthies of Hebrews eleventh, we had them testify on
    how they came to Christ, the one thing they did and what they got. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg 12]</span>
    answers were all intelligent and to the point. <i>Decision</i> was what they did,
    and <i>Christ</i> was what they got, were the answers put in various forms. At
    the close of the meeting I asked a gentleman, a member of another church,
    the Berean Baptist, who always attends our special services, to say a few
    words. He testified to the help and inspiration he had received from the
    meetings; that he had never listened to clearer testimonies of conversion
    than those given by the converts, and that they were doubly blessed
    in having &quot;<i>our pastor</i>,&quot; &quot;yes,&quot; he said, &quot;I will say our pastor, for he is pastor
    to this whole community and city, lead you to Christ, and train
    you for service.&quot; His remarks were warm and sympathetic, but too
    personal for me to report more than the above, which is but the key-note
    of the kindly feeling that many of the best Christian people of other
    churches have toward us, as they have seen our little church come up
    from almost nothing to its present position of service in this community.
    It has been the Lord's doings and it is wondrous in our eyes. We have
    already begun the work of training these young disciples for service, while
    we have our nets still spread to catch sinners for Christ. Our motto for
    the year is: To win souls for Christ and to train them for His service.</p>

    <h4>A GLAD THANKSGIVING.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY MISS MARY A. BYE, WILLIAMSBURG, KY.</p>
    <p>If any one had been the least bit homesick or unhappy from any cause
    on Thanksgiving day, it would have done him good to spend the day at
    Williamsburg Academy. Our boys and girls were so happy all the day that
    no one could feel tired or sad. After breakfast the boys thought it hardly
    fair for them to have all the holiday while the girls had to work, so they
    borrowed aprons and helped the girls. Dishwashing, sweeping and all the
    various branches of housework were done in a very short time, and everybody
    was as merry as could be. The boys declared that they were glad to
    have learned something which they did not know before, about the work the
    girls had to do. Our very tallest boy, over six feet in height, was instructed
    in the mysteries of scouring knives. He said he had no idea how knives
    were cleaned, and thought his Thanksgiving lesson worth learning.</p>
    <p>After the housework was done the boys gathered a great quantity of
    holly, and our pretty new dining-room was profusely decorated. All the
    family then attended the Thanksgiving services in the Christian Church;
    that is all except the &quot;Mother,&quot; who must needs watch the dinner in process
    of preparation. We had a real Thanksgiving feast, in all except that
    our turkey was fried chicken.</p>
    <p>Mr. Tupper contributed oranges, which were quite a treat. One of the
    girls came to mother very much excited, eyes wide open and hands up,
    exclaiming &quot;O, Mrs. Bye, what are them big yeller things in the dining
    room?&quot; When told that they were oranges, she said, &quot;Law! I never seed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg 13]</span>
    none before.&quot; There were others who had never tasted them, and they
    watched closely to see how the teachers managed them, before they ventured
    to eat theirs. Two of the teachers had written Thanksgiving verses
    on cards tied with ribbon, and placed at each plate. After dinner we
    moved our chairs back and read our verses, after which we sang &quot;Praise
    God from whom all blessings flow,&quot; and I think it is rarely sung more
    heartily. Then again the boys donned the aprons and cleared the tables
    and washed the dishes, while the teachers watched the fun and laughed until
    we were tired. While the molasses was boiling, the scholars played
    games in the sitting-rooms. Then came the &quot;candy-pull,&quot; and very
    <i>sweetly</i> closed the day's festivities.</p>
    <p>I am sure we went to prayer meeting in the evening with very thankful
    hearts. Some of the scholars said it was the happiest day they had ever
    known.</p>
    <p>It is a constant wonder to me to see the improvement in our girls, and
    their interest in their work. They are so eager to learn to do things well
    that I cannot think of my work as one of sacrifice, as some work may be,
    for the joy of it overcomes all such thought.</p>

    <a name="south4" id="south4"></a>
    <h4>STRAIGHT UNIVERSITY, NEW ORLEANS.</h4>
    <p class="author">REV. C.H. CRAWFORD.</p>
    <p>Much interest is manifest in our meetings for prayer, a number of students
    having expressed a desire to become Christians. I have organized
    a class for the instruction of Christian workers. It is composed of both
    teachers and students, and numbers about twenty-five.</p>
    <p>A young man came to my study to be shown how to become a Christian.
    After instructing him and showing him the promises, there still
    seemed to be something in the way. Questioning him, I found that he was
    expecting some wonderful experience. He had specially in mind the
    remarkable conversion of a certain young man of his acquaintance. He
    was hoping for the same. I said to him, &quot;Now you want to know that
    you are a Christian. Which would you rather have for evidence, an experience
    such as that young man had, or God's word for it?&quot; After waiting
    a moment to take in my meaning he replied, &quot;God's word.&quot; &quot;Do you
    believe on Jesus Christ?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Well, here you have God's word,
    John, 3:36, 'He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life.' Will you
    take God's word?&quot; After a moment's deliberation came the answer,
    &quot;Yes, I will.&quot; Then we knelt down and prayed. This, I trust, was a soul
    born into the kingdom.</p>
    <p>One of our theological students reports the following admonition from
    an ignorant preacher much older than himself: &quot;You go to school and get
    education. In five or ten years the people will not listen to such preachers
    as I am.&quot;<!-- Page 18 --></p>

    <h4>TILLOTSON INSTITUTE, AUSTIN, TEXAS.</h4>
    <p>Our school is opening very auspiciously. Never before have so large a
    number been here at the beginning of the term. And the requests for the
    privilege of coming are numerous, so that if all come who are asking to do
    so, we shall be over-full. We are greatly pleased with the spirit with which
    the new year's work is taken up. There are more each year who come
    prepared to enter the higher grades, which shows that the common schools
    of Texas are improving.</p>
    <p>The Christian Endeavor Societies, of both the young men and the young
    women, have elected their officers and are ready to begin work again, and
    the Temperance Society will do the same, this week.</p>
    <p>One of the students who has been with us from the beginning of our
    school, has left us this year and gone to Oberlin, where he has entered the
    Sophomore class. We miss him much, but bid him &quot;God Speed,&quot; for the
    need of workers is great, and we are hoping much from him in the way of
    work among his own people.</p>

    <h3>THE INDIANS.</h3>
    <h4>MISSIONARY LIFE AMONG THE DAKOTA INDIANS.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY MRS. J.F. CROSS.</p>
    <p>It is hard to get the most interesting experiences of a missionary's life,
    because they belong to the daily routine and so are often unmentioned.
    But here is a description of life and travel among the Indians, by the wife
    of a missionary just going to the Dakotas:</p>
    <p>The land of the Dakotas&mdash;what a distance! How long the miles
    seemed from my home! How frightful the land seemed to me, from the
    tales of blizzards and cyclones! How strange to go to live among the
    Sioux Indians, known to me principally for the Minnesota, Fort Fetterman
    and Custer massacres; to be a friend to Sitting Bull, Brave Bull, Gall,
    Grass, Swift Bear, Red Cloud and many others with names no less picturesque!
    With such impressions I left my home to accompany my husband
    to his home and work at Rosebud Agency, South Dakota.</p>
    <p>I was soon relieved of the idea of the distance, for only a few hours
    took us across Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota to the border
    of Dakota. Here we left the railroad to attend the general conference
    of the Dakota Mission at Flandreau. How quickly all the impressions of
    years can be changed, when the impressions are wrong and we see the true
    state of affairs. In this case, seeing hundreds of bronzed faces, lighted up
    with joy, as they sung &quot;I hear Thy welcome voice&quot; in their own tongue,
    there was enough to change all my former opinions of Indians in general
    and of the Dakota Indians in particular. It was like coming into a new
    world. That is, it was finding those whom I thought belonged to another,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg 15]</span>
    lower, baser life, living the same life with myself; rejoicing in that which
    is my greatest joy&mdash;childhood with God the Father. And after meeting
    Ehnamani, Grey Cloud, John Wakeman, Spotted Bear, and many others;
    after hearing them discuss living topics&mdash;living topics to them because they
    belong to the change from heathen to Christian life; after hearing them
    pray&mdash;though I could not understand a word, yet from their earnestness I
    could understand the spirit of their prayer; after all this, I could scarcely
    believe that these men had ever been Indians in paint, feathers, dances and
    on the war path. Thus I spent my first four days among Indians. And
    even if preaching, prayers, discussions were in an unknown tongue, I perhaps,
    understood as much as I would at many a Presbytery or Conference
    meeting. And I got as much good from the Dakota sermon as I have from
    many an English sermon.</p>
    <p>Not the least pleasing of my new impressions were those made by the
    missionaries present. Rev. John P. Williamson, of Yankton Agency; Rev.
    A.L. Riggs, D.D., of Santee Mission and Normal School; Rev. T.L.
    Riggs of Oahe, or rather the apostle to the Tetons, were the life of the meetings
    whether in English or Dakota. They came from and returned to the
    work to which their lives are given. I did not meet these men with the
    greetings of a certain minister there, who asked, &quot;How many years have
    you been in the Indian work.&quot; &quot;About twenty,&quot; was the reply. Then the
    minister said: &quot;Well, you have been in the work so long that you would
    not be much good anywhere else.&quot; My impression was that such men
    would be now, as they always have been, successful in any field of labor.
    But I must leave Flandreau with its citizen Indians, ready to vote for prohibition
    in the Constitution of South Dakota, for this is not our field of labor.</p>
    <p>The next scene is one which I shall long remember&mdash;our reception at
    a mission home. Other homes may be happy and other people may welcome
    me to their homes; but few&mdash;none that I have met&mdash;can welcome
    one so cordially as Mrs. Riggs welcomed us to her home at Oahe. This is
    a long-to-be-remembered experience. And after spending a week at Oahe,
    meeting the teachers and pupils of the school, and the citizen Indians there
    we started for our own home and work, Park Street Church Station.
    This place has been the home of my husband for a year.</p>
    <p>Crossing the Missouri is one of the first of our experiences. The team
    and wagon are loaded on the boat, the men row a few rods, then the boat
    stops. &quot;Bar,&quot; remarks Mr. Cross, &quot;got to tow;&quot; when, horrors! &quot;Is this
    a missionary I see?&quot; Mr. Cross is in the water, sometimes to his knees,
    sometimes to his waist. Thus they tow the boat a half mile. From the
    way they hold their breath the water must be cold. Well, it is October 10,
    in blizzard-swept Dakota. But after two hours of work we are safely
    landed on the west side of the river and soon we are toiling slowly out of
    the <i>breaks</i> of the river. After a ride of a few hours we come to a creek
    with no water but plenty of wood. Here dinner is announced. This is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg 16]</span>
    camping in earnest. This is not play. Camping in the East is generally
    within sound of the cackle of the hen and the low of the cow. But here
    you must live off of the land or out of your mess-chest. We combine the
    two. Many hotels and families could learn a good lesson from an experienced
    traveler and camper. In less than thirty minutes from the time we
    stop, horses are unharnessed, fire built, prairie chicken dressed and
    cooked, coffee made, table spread, blessing asked and we busy with the
    tender and juicy chicken. This is the same order at each meal.</p>
    <p>At night we sleep on the earth and under the sky, with but little between
    us and either sky or earth. This is a new and somewhat larger bedroom
    than I have been used to. But with no house within twenty miles we
    are unmolested. What a place! I listen. &quot;All the air a solemn stillness
    holds.&quot; I look. &quot;So lonesome it is that God himself scarce seems to be
    there.&quot; But the clear air and quiet night soon lull me into unbroken
    slumber. Thus we travel until we reach Park St. Church Station, where
    we find our comfortable log house of one room ready to receive us. Though
    we reach the house at eleven o'clock at night, a full half dozen come to
    greet us, saying, &quot;Catka, winyau waste luha, lila caute ma waste.&quot; &quot;Left
    Hand, (Mr. Cross) you have a good woman, so I am happy.&quot; Sunday
    comes; at eleven o'clock we go to the neat little room, chapel and schoolroom.
    Here fifty men and women with children of all ages, listen with eagerness
    and attention to Mr. Cross as he tells them of the wise men who came
    to seek Jesus. Some of the faces are dirty, and so is much of the clothing.
    But all listen as if they perhaps might see this same Jesus. This is
    Dakota, our field, our people to save.</p>

    <h4>NEW CHURCH AT FORT YATES, NORTH DAKOTA.</h4>
    <p class="author">REV. T.L. RIGGS.</p>
    <p>On Sunday, the 8th, we took steps here in the organization of a new
    church. By invitation, two of our Oahe Church, Solomon Bear Ear and
    David Lee, were present from the Cheyenne River Agency, and it was judged
    wise to organize. The Apostles' Creed and a short Covenant were offered
    as Articles of Faith and the pledge. The nine members of our Oahe church
    whose homes are at Grand River and Fort Yates will become members here
    on dismission at Oahe, and the native workers and other missionaries will
    also transfer their connection, so that if all do so, the new church will
    have a membership of eighteen or twenty.</p>
    <p>In connection with these services the new chapel was dedicated to the
    Master's service by public expression; it has already been so consecrated. I
    doubt not, in the heart of the giver of the funds, as well as by the prayers of
    all who have been interested in it. Is is a bright, pleasant room within, and
    has a snug appearance from without. I think Mr. Reed has made a very
    creditable success in this his first building.</p>

    <h3>THE CHINESE.</h3>
    <h4>CHINA FOR CHRIST.</h4>
    <p class="author">BY REV. WM. C. POND, D.D.</p>
    <p>It is quite possible (though I do not distinctly remember about it,) that
    our readers have seen this caption at the head of my articles more than
    once already. Be that as it may, I am sure that such persons as read this
    Magazine cannot be weary of it. It is the motto of our corporation
    adopted twelve or thirteen years ago. It then looked rather magniloquent
    for a work so humble as ours; but there was promise in it, and
    prophecy, and nothing less would satisfy either our Chinese brethren or
    myself. This promise and prophecy begin to be fulfilled. We hoped
    then, and now we are gladdened by oft-recurring confirmations of our
    hope, that we were laboring not only for these sojourners in our own land,
    but for a mighty multitude to be reached by their testimony, and to be
    leavened by the influence of their example.</p>
    <p>This will be illustrated for our readers by the following extract from an
    address delivered by one of our brethren at the last anniversary of our
    mission at Santa Cruz. His English will require a little straightening, but
    for the most part, I will give it just as spoken:</p>
    <p><i>Dear Friends</i>: I am glad to see you all here this evening; and that you
    have an interest in the Chinese work. I will tell you a few words about myself,
    what experience I had in my native land. I left California to go to China,
    July 15, 1887, and after thirty-one days, reached my home. I found a piece
    of red paper on the wall above my cooking place, with the name of the
    stove-god written on it. We call it &quot;Doy Shin;&quot; &quot;Doy&quot; means &quot;Stove,&quot;
    &quot;Shin&quot; means &quot;god.&quot; Every family worships the stove-god at the cooking
    place. The first of every month they burn some punk, and twice
    every month make a fresh cup of tea, which is left standing on the stove.
    I found that several thousands of punk had been burned during my absence,
    and the ends of the sticks were left in the bowls. I felt very sorry
    for it; so I tore up the paper and break the punk-sticks in pieces and
    burn them up. My wife felt very indignant, and was afraid the stove-god
    might be angry and make me sick, and punish me. I say: &quot;Nothing to be
    afraid of. But I am only afraid that the true God in heaven will punish
    me if I do not tear up the paper and burn up the punk-sticks.&quot; I say: &quot;I
    must entirely abandon this superstition and must give this testimony for
    Christ. For he is the only God that can preserve my life, and the only
    one that can take it away.&quot;</p>
    <p>In the mean time, a Chinese preacher who was supported by the Methodist
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg 18]</span>
    Mission was very sick. His children were very small and his wife
    cannot walk. There was nobody to go after a doctor for him. So he sent
    for me to call doctor and get medicine. He and myself were the only
    Christians inside the walls of the city. Outside in the villages were a few
    Christians, but fifteen or twenty miles away. My wife advised me not to
    go to his house lest I get sick also, for my health was not very good. I
    say to her, that only he and I are Christians in this place. I <i>have</i> to go
    to his house. I rather die than not go. In about twenty days he die.
    We sent for the Christian friends, from different parts&mdash;some thirty to fifty
    miles away&mdash;some nearer. So we bury him the Christian way. The men
    carry the coffin. They charge four dollars to bury him, because he is
    Christian. The others they charge only two dollars. We also hire music
    for the funeral&mdash;different from the heathen funeral. Several hundred people
    were standing on the way, watching us pass by. Some say: &quot;How
    funny the burying of the Yason dog,&quot;&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, the Jesus boy.</p>
    <p>After the funeral I was very sick, and my whole body trembling with
    cold. Many blankets put upon me, but cannot make me warm. My wife
    begin to cry. My cousins and all said it was because I went to the dead
    man's house and catch the sickness. Some of them said it was because
    I tore up the paper and burned the punk-sticks of the stove-god. But
    my wife, sitting on the bed-side crying, suggested the medicine which I
    brought from California; the name&mdash;sulphate of quinine. So she ask me
    to take that; but I say: I never have been this way before, and never use
    that medicine for this kind of sickness. But she ask me to try; so I take
    a very little with a little water. Not more than three minutes my whole
    body stop shaking, and I felt a great relief. I thank God for his help, and
    soon I got all well.</p>
    <p>Another Chinese preacher came from Canton to my district to take the
    dead preacher's place; also, to live in his house. Next day, he and his
    wife and boy all taken very sick. They grow worse and worse, every day
    appointed to death. I felt very much dismayed because many people
    say, &quot;The Death Spirit make them very sick because they will not worship
    him.&quot; But I pray to God to make him well. I say:&mdash;&quot;Oh Lord, if
    you let this family die also, all the people in this place will not
    like to hear thy Gospel, and I also may be tempted by the superstition.
    I ask thee, oh God, let thy mercy be upon them and not
    let this family going to die; so let all this people of darkness see thy
    power, and thy glorious light appear to their sight.&quot; I believe that God
    answered this prayer, for they grew better and better every day, though
    they were so sick they expected to die.</p>
    <p>I will tell you of another trial which I encountered. I live inside the
    wall, and all the people inside are divided into six societies. I belong to
    No. 4. Once in three years we have what we call <i>festival</i>. So a man who
    had charge asked me to sign my name to give twenty-five cents to buy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg 19]</span>
    some pork and other things for offerings to the idols. The temples have
    some property, but they use the temple money for other expenses. I
    refuse to subscribe. So he advised me and said: &quot;While you are in the
    foreign country, imitate foreign customs, but now you are in China, you
    have to obey Chinese customs.&quot; They try to compel me to give. I stand
    up and say: &quot;If these six societies could not have this festival to the
    idols because I refuse, do the people depend on me? If so, then all the
    people are without hope, and may despair of the blessing of the idols. Is
    that what you believe? Because you worship the idols you give offerings
    to them, and expect blessing from them. I do not worship the idol, and he
    would not give me the blessing. I do not wish for the idol's blessing. It
    is not because I am stingy that I will not give to the offering of the idol,
    but because it is against the true God in heaven, whom I trust, and whose
    blessing I do greatly desire.&quot; So they could not compel me to give, and they
    let me alone, but they felt very much indignation and were hostile to me.
    A Christian in China has sometimes a very hard time. &quot;But what
    things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.&quot; Yet more and
    more are believing the Gospel of Christ every year in China.</p>
    <p>A year has passed since, this brother returned to America; but is there
    any hazard in affirming that those towns-people of his in China have
    thought more or less, even to this day, of the stand he took and the God
    in Christ to whom he testified?</p>

    <h3>BUREAU OF WOMAN'S WORK.</h3>
    <p class="author">MISS D.E. EMERSON, SECRETARY.</p>
    <h4>MASS MEETING OF THE WOMAN'S HOME MISSIONARY UNIONS.</h4>
    <p>The first meeting of the Woman's Home Missionary Unions in connection
    with the American Missionary Association was a genuine success.
    The programme was put in the hands of Mrs. E.S. Williams of Minnesota by
    vote of the ladies at Saratoga in June last, and the interested group who
    filled the large and pleasant Sunday-school rooms of the New England
    Church in Chicago, October 29th, rejoiced in their new and forward movement
    for home and native land. Mrs. Lane of Michigan gave Mrs.
    Williams genial help in presiding. Mrs. Palmer of Massachusetts led in
    prayer. Mrs. Burke Leavitt, President of the Illinois Union, gave to the
    ladies a felicitous welcome to the city and to the sympathy of the workers
    of the great state of Illinois. Mrs. E.W. Blatchford greeted the women
    in behalf of the New England Church and of their co-workers in the W.B.M.I.
    If only all good women saw and felt, as this wise sister did, that
    all Christ's work is one, and that all work for him outside of our own
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg 20]</span>
    home and church is mission service, their appeals to their sisters would
    have more irresistible force, and the Saviour's prayer be nearer answered,
    &quot;That they all may be one.&quot; Miss Emerson, of the American Missionary
    Association, spoke with her usual straightforward effectiveness of the joy of
    the Association in their share of the work of the Unions.</p>
    <p>These greetings were followed by the roll-call of State Unions, with brief
    responses. Mrs. Williams represented Minnesota; Mrs. Palmer, Massachusetts
    and Rhode Island. She also read a letter from Miss Nathalie
    Lord of Boston. Mrs. Grabill responded for Michigan, Mrs. Cowles for
    Ohio, Mrs. Morgan for New York, Mrs. Miner for Wisconsin, Mrs.
    Bronson for Missouri, Mrs. Taintor for Illinois, Mrs. Douglass for Iowa,
    Mrs. Leavitt for Nebraska, and Miss Emerson for Mississippi, Tennessee,
    Arkansas and North Carolina. A telegram was received from Mrs.
    Gale of the Florida Union, letters from Mrs. Swift of Vermont and
    Mrs. Andrews of Alabama, and a warm message from Louisiana came just
    too late for public hearing. Greetings also came from Northern and
    Southern California, Oregon and Colorado.</p>
    <p>After prayer by Mrs. Douglass, of Iowa, Miss Hand gave a brief, but
    very effective address on &quot;What the New West needs from our Women&mdash;prayer,
    consecrated effort, contributions.&quot;</p>
    <p>In the afternoon, Mrs. Lane gave a complete summary of &quot;Foreign
    Missions at Home. What have we done? What have we left undone?
    What ought we to do now?&quot; No brief mention can give any adequate idea
    of the amount of information which was crowded into this address, or the
    earnestness of its presentation.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Regal, of Oberlin, presented the report of the Bohemian Bible
    Readers' Home, in Cleveland.</p>
    <p>Mrs. E.M. Williams answered effectively the question, &quot;How can we
    induce women of wealth to give to Home Missions?&quot; She thought lack of
    information was the cause of most of the indifference from which the work
    suffers, and recommended individual effort as likeliest to be successful.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Bailey, of Ogden, Utah, gave a stirring address on the &quot;Need of
    Pure Homes and True Churches in the West.&quot;</p>
    <p>Elizabeth Winyan, a Christian Indian woman of the Dakotas, next addressed
    the meeting in her native language, Rev. Mr. Riggs acting as her
    interpreter. Elizabeth's manner is very calm and dignified, and her gestures
    are graceful and forcible. Her language is eloquent even though trammeled
    by the necessity of having an interpreter. When she &quot;shakes hands
    with us in her heart,&quot; we know she means it, and when she has &quot;said
    enough,&quot; we know she is done.</p>
    <p>A Free Parliament for the discussion of practical questions was conducted
    by Mrs. Regal, of Ohio. The subjects of Missionary Literature,
    Life-Membership, Dangers threatening the Unions, Holding meetings in
    connection with or separate from local and State Conferences, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg 21]</span>
    National Organization, were discussed, a large number of ladies participating
    freely.</p>
    <p>Mrs. Goodell, of St. Louis, conducted a &quot;Sweet Hour of Prayer,&quot; which
    closed the day's sessions, and the earnest group dissolved only to swell the
    throngs at the best meeting the American Missionary Association ever
    held.</p>

    <h4>WORDS FROM OUR ANNUAL MEETING,</h4>
    <h5>OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO WOMEN.</h5>
    <p>Twenty-six Woman's State Organizations now co-operate with us in our
    missionary work. Each year shows the increasing importance and helpfulness
    of the Woman's Bureau. From it go counsel, help and inspiration
    to the lady teachers in the field, and missionary news and helpful suggestions
    to the ladies of the State Associations. Through it pass the sympathy
    and the help of the earnest workers in the older churches to the earnest
    workers in our mission churches and schools. The people for whom we
    labor can not be saved either for this world or the next unless the women
    who make the homes are lifted out of coarseness and vice, and taught true
    womanhood and womanly duties and arts. The Woman's Bureau is a
    most potent factor in the work of bringing the gospel to the rescue of
    womanhood in our mission fields.</p>
    <p class="author"><i>Annual Report of Executive Committee.</i></p>
    <hr />
    <p>Our laborers are faced by all the serious problems of the foreign land&mdash;problems
    unrelieved by a single romantic charm. When we send our
    missionaries to Africa they go to labor among the Africans; and when we
    send them down South they go to teach &quot;niggers.&quot; I believe that the
    American Missionary Association, in its calm and unimpassioned history,
    is one grand and splendid eulogy of woman. Our sisters went South while
    the sky was yet heavy with the clouds of war; they went to the rude
    dwellings where those people sat in stupor and in darkness after the first
    thrill of the new found liberty; they went from homes of refinement and
    culture and wealth and religion; they bore to this darkness light, to this
    dullness life; they carried down there in their white hands the great tree
    of Calvary, the cross of Christ, and planted it in the land of the magnolia
    and the palm. I say that the history of this Association is a grand and
    glowing eulogy of woman because these were willing to be called &quot;teachers
    of niggers&quot; for their love of humanity.</p>
    <p class="author"><i>Rev. C.W. Hiatt.</i></p>
    <hr />
    <p>It is one of the most astonishing signs of the times that really into the
    feeble hand of womanhood is given the key of the situation. They respect
    these educated girls, they reverence them and give them a place of dignity
    in their hearts. That makes it possible for these women to do a large and
    splendid work in the South.</p>
    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg 22]</span></p>
    <p>Once let these girls that come under the influence of our Christian
    Northern women who go there as teachers, and the graduates of these
    various colleges and schools that we have planted, and are about to plant
    in the South; once let common womanhood in the South that has been so
    much under the heel of this oppression; once let girlhood feel the power
    that has come to girlhood, that to them as young women in the cradle of
    these hills, under this fair sky, is given the power to turn over in not less
    than thirty or forty years this whole country for God and humanity, for
    enlightenment and for Christian peace; once let that idea get into the minds
    of those girls, and we have not the same problem that we have to-day.</p>

    <p>There were deeds of valor by mountain heroines that shine as brightly
    as those of a Molly Stark or Barbara Frietchie. Mrs. Edwards, of Campbell
    County, marched 150 miles in inclement weather, over the mountains,
    to carry information to Union troops. Immediately upon arriving at
    home, having received some valuable information, she pushed her way
    through the rain, on horseback, alone, and saved the Union General Spears
    from capture. Again and again this same woman took perilous journeys
    to carry information to Union officers. Nor was she the only heroine among
    the mountain women. During the siege of Knoxville, General Grant
    desired to send an important message to General Burnside. &quot;So overrun
    was the territory between Chattanooga and Knoxville by Confederate
    troops that it could only be delivered, if at all, with great difficulty and
    hazard. At length Miss Mary Love, of Kingston, Tenn., agreed to take
    the message through the Confederate lines.&quot; She got as far as Louisville,
    Tenn., but could get no farther. There she found but one person who
    was willing to run the risk of taking the message through the lines, and he
    was a boy only thirteen years of age, John T. Brown. He carried the dispatch
    safely through the lines and delivered it to General Burnside.</p>
    <p>Let us build school-houses and churches, where their better cabins have
    risen from the ashes of the past. Let us invade their coves and press up
    their mountain sides with an army of Christian teachers and preachers,
    until the gray old forests that echoed with the shout of these loyal Highlanders
    shall again echo with the sound of church bell and school bell, and
    they who took from us the larger sacrifice of war, shall find that we are
    ready to share with them the blessed fruits of peace.</p>

    <p>There is, furthermore, a peaceful Christian invasion of this land. We
    scarcely realize how much these gospel songs mean to those Southern people,
    and how they listen with eagerness at once to the sweetness of the
    tune and to the gospel that is within it. It is an entering wedge to a new
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg 23]</span>
    life there. A dear girl of my acquaintance taught from thirty to fifty of
    these women; they listened eagerly, and the tears rolled down their cheeks,
    and they said to her, &quot;Oh, come and tell us more about Jesus, for we want
    to be different kind of women, different kind of mothers.&quot;</p>
    <p>There was one girl who came out to one of our commencements
    and went back with the arrow in her heart, saying, &quot;I would give all the
    world if I had it, if I could write a piece, and git up thar and read it like
    them.&quot; She went home determined she would go to college. She was a
    large girl, fifteen years old, yet did not know a single letter. She walked
    fifty miles nearly, and came and said to the college president, that she
    wanted to work for her board, so that she could enter the school. What
    could she do? He found that really she was incapacitated for doing anything;
    but she said; &quot;I can hoe corn like a nigger.&quot; Finally she was set
    at some sort of work, and that girl, after three or four years, went out as a
    school teacher into a district where young men dared not go, where her
    eyes were blistered with the sights she saw&mdash;men shot down before her
    face and eyes by the whiskey distillers&mdash;and she was asked to organize a
    Sunday-school there. When any one starts a Sunday-school he is expected
    to preach, and so that girl had to become a preacher, and to-day
    she is preaching the gospel of God and spreading the work there.
    And yet she came from one of the very humblest classes.</p>
    <p class="author"><i>Rev. D.M. Fisk.</i></p>
    <hr />
    <p>There is another influence of which I would speak, the influence of the
    home. Here in our happy homes we know but very little of what that
    means to the Indian. An Indian has no home, in our sense of the
    word. There is at Santee Agency a piece of limestone, perhaps three feet
    wide by five feet long, which was the hearthstone of our Dakota mission
    home. It was taken a few years ago by my brother, from Minnesota,
    where it had served the purpose of a hearthstone in one of the original
    buildings of the mission. He took it to Santee Agency, and every time I
    go to Santee, I go out and look at that stone. There is the hole in the
    stone into which we poured milk to feed the cat, and on another corner is
    the place where we used to crack nuts. That stands for our boyhood home.
    The Indian has nothing of the kind. The Dakota Indian lives in a region,
    not in a place. The Christian home coming into the midst of a village
    carries there an ideal of which the Indian knows nothing, and he is taught
    by the power of example day after day. The Christian woman in that
    home keeps her house clean, keeps her children clean, and stands here as
    a persistent example of the power of the gospel of soap.</p>

    <hr />
    <p>Carlyle tells the story of a woman in the North of Scotland in the old
    days before charity was organized, who wanted help. She was poor and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg 24]</span>
    sick, and they said to her, &quot;You may look out for yourself.&quot; Finally she
    was taken sick with typhus fever, and died, and because they didn't take
    very good care of her in the place where she was sick, she killed seventeen
    others with her poison. Carlyle says: &quot;You said she was not your sister
    and she said, 'I am, and I will prove it;' and she did, though it cost seventeen
    good lives to prove it.&quot; There will be a typhus fever in this land
    infinitely worse than any pestilence that kills the body unless this deadly
    germ be killed by putting education where there is ignorance, and putting
    honor and truth where there is degradation to-day. &quot;Look out for No.
    1?&quot; Aye, it is our business to look out for ourselves. May God Almighty
    help us that we fail not to attend to it. There is just one way to save ourselves.
    We learned that long ago at the feet of Him who said: &quot;He that
    loseth his life shall save it.&quot; That is the only way. It is just as true for a
    nation as for an individual.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
